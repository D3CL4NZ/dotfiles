# D3CL4NZ's Official&trade; Dotfiles

The dotfiles I use on my own machine.

```zsh
curl -L declanz.me/dotfiles.sh | zsh
```

This script is meant to be used with zsh. The dotfiles are meant to be used with [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) and [Powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) on ArchLinux.
